This is a chat application secured with RSA encryption and steganography.

## Getting Started

The message which is sent to opponent user is encrypted using opponent user public key and again the ciphertext is encoded in image using Least Significant Bit(LSB) technique and at the receiver side the ciphertext is extracted from the image and decoded using the private key.

the process is also done for sender as well using sender own public key.
